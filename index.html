        <h1>Evolution of the American inner city</h1>
        <h2>Intentions</h2>
        <p>Through this site I intend to develop my programming. As well as shed a 
            light on the rapid change facing the city of Newark. Ultimately I'll have 
            an excuse to spend time researching the phenomenom of gentrification in 
            the city I grew up. </p>
        <h2>Material</h2>
        <p>I plan on filling thise site with pictures taken by Kelly and I. As well
            as links to credible sources regarding environmnts within this community.
            Also most importantly to me is being able to have a place to share my
            experiences.</p>
